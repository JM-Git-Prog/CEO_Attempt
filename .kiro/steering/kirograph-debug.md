# KiroGraph: Debug Workflow

Follow these steps to systematically trace and debug issues using the knowledge graph.

## Steps

1. **Find related code**
   ```
   kirograph_search(query: "<error message or symptom keywords>")
   ```

2. **Get full context**
   ```
   kirograph_context(task: "<describe the bug>")
   ```

3. **Check what recently changed in related symbols**
   ```
   kirograph_diff_context()
   ```
   Most bugs trace back to recent changes — this surfaces them immediately.

4. **Trace the call chain**
   ```
   kirograph_callers(symbol: "<suspected function>")
   kirograph_callees(symbol: "<suspected function>")
   ```

5. **Understand blast radius**
   ```
   kirograph_impact(symbol: "<root cause symbol>", depth: 3)
   ```

## Tips
- Check both callers and callees to understand the full context
- `kirograph_diff_context` is the fastest way to spot a regression — check it first
- Use `kirograph_path` to trace how two symbols are connected
